### Accountability in Goal setting

Goal Setting is easy however accomplishing them would be hard if 
accountability is not in-place. 

#### What is accountability?

Doing what you are gonna plan , it can be a yearly thing, however it is more effective
when it is used within shorter periods of time (ie weekly or bi weekly), ideally this
helps us to identify what can be done and what has to change.

Accountability is highligted as one of the most important elements in most of the
productivity books ( Atomic habits, Feel good productivity & Million Dollar Weekend ).

#### Example application

Jane and Diana wants to stay fit and this is really hard with the busy schedules of their 9-5 , but what if
they can weekly catchup and help each other, whether it be sharing what they did, what challenges they faced
and how they overcome the challenges.

#### Practical Steps to Implement Accountability

Achieving your goals is more manageable when you apply a systematic approach to accountability. Here are four streamlined steps to guide you:

**1) Choose the Right Accountability Partner**

Find someone genuinely interested in your success who can offer honest feedback. This partner should be a reliable motivator, ready to challenge you and celebrate your progress.

**2) Set Clear, Achievable Goals**

Use the SMART framework to define your goals: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. This approach helps translate your ambitions into actionable steps.

**3) Establish Regular Check-Ins**

Commit to frequent check-ins with your accountability partnerâ€”whether weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly. These discussions are vital for assessing progress, facing challenges, and adjusting plans as necessary.

**4) Embrace Technology**

Incorporate goal-tracking apps or platforms to streamline your progress monitoring. Tools like Trello or Habitica can organize your objectives, while apps like MyFitnessPal connect you with a community for additional motivation.
